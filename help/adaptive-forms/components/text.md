# Text {#text-adaptive-forms-core-component}

In an Adaptive Form, text refers to the content that is displayed on the form for the user to read. This can include the text that is used to label a group of form elements, such as text fields, as well as any additional instructions or information that is provided to the user.

This can also help divide a form's structure into logical sections, making it easier for users to understand and complete the form. Additionally, it could be used for accessibility purpose to give a brief description of the element it is associated with. Such text field is typically displayed near the form components, such as before or after it.

*   **Provide context**: Text can be used to provide context for the form, such as explaining the purpose of the form or the organization collecting the information.

*   **Divide the form into logical sections**: Text can be used to divide a form into logical sections, making it easier for users to understand and complete the form.
