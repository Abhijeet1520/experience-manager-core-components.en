# Email input {#email-input-adaptive-forms-core-component}

The Adaptive Form Email input Core Component is used to collect email addresses from users. It is typically represented as a text box and has pattern validations to accept only valid email addresses. The email input field can be further customized with additional attributes such as "required", "placeholder", and "pattern" to set validations for the input data.

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a an email input component in an Adaptive Form, including: 

*   **Validation**: The email input field allows the browser to validate that the entered data is a valid email address format.

*   **User Convenience**: An email input makes it easier for users to enter their email addresses as it provides a clear indication of the data expected in the field.

*   **Personalized Communication**: Collecting email addresses from users through a form allows for personalized communication, such as sending confirmation emails or newsletters.

*   **Lead Generation**: By collecting email addresses through a form, businesses can build their email list and use it for lead generation.

*   **User Authentication**: Email addresses can be used as a means of authentication for accessing restricted content or services.

*   **Feedback Collection**: An email input in a feedback form allows the business to communicate with the user for follow-up or clarification on their feedback.
