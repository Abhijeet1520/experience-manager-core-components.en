# Horizontal tabs {#horizontal-tabs-adaptive-forms-core-component}

Horizontal tabs in an Adaptive Form refer to a design pattern where multiple sections of a form are grouped together and displayed as separate tabs, aligned horizontally. The user can switch between the tabs to access different sections of the form. Each tab acts as a trigger to show and hide the related form content. The horizontal tabs help to organize long forms into manageable sections and improve the user experience. Tabs can help to make a form more accessible for users with disabilities, as they can switch between sections using keyboard navigation.

The tabs are usually created as a series of links or buttons, with each link or button corresponding to a section of the form. When a user clicks on a tab, the form content is dynamically updated to show the corresponding section.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-horizontal-tabs}

The common reasons to use horizontal tabs in an Adaptive Form are:

*   **Improved Usability**: Horizontal tabs make it easier for users to navigate through the form, especially if the form has multiple sections or a large number of fields.

*   **Space Management**: Horizontal tabs help to conserve screen space by grouping related form sections into tabs and displaying only one section at a time.

*   **Better Organization**: Tabs provide a clear and organized structure for a form, making it easier for users to understand and complete the form.

*   **Increased User Engagement**: Horizontal tabs can make a form more visually appealing and engaging for users, which can improve the form completion rate.
