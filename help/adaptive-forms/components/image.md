# Image {#image-adaptive-forms-core-component}

An Image component in an Adaptive Form is a way to include images in a form. These images can be used to enhance the overall design of the form, provide additional information, or serve as a visual aid to help users understand the form's purpose. The image component can be used to add a logo, a photo, or a graphic in the form.

For accessibility, it is important to specify **Alternate text** to the image to provide a short, descriptive text alternative for the image, that describes the image to users who cannot see it.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-image-in-a-form}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include an Image component in an Adaptive Form, including:

*   **Branding**: An image can be used to display the logo or name of the organization that created the form, helping to establish brand recognition and credibility.

*   **Visual Aids**: An image can help to provide an additional level of information to users, by serving as a visual aid to help users understand the form's purpose.

*   **Decoration**: An image can be used to enhance the overall design of the form and make it more visually appealing.

*   **User Experience**: An image can be used to make the form more user-friendly by providing a clear and intuitive way for users to access and fill in form fields.
