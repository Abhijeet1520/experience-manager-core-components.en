# Wizard {#wizard-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A Wizard layout in an Adaptive Form refers to a form that is divided into multiple steps or pages, with the user moving through the form one step at a time. This layout is called a "wizard" because it guides the user through the form in a step-by-step process.

Each step of the wizard typically contains a group of related form fields and a navigation mechanism, such as "Next" and "Back" buttons, to move between steps. The user can only proceed to the next step once the current step has been completed and all required fields have been filled out.

Wizard layout is useful for forms that have a lot of fields or information that need to be collected, as it breaks the form down into smaller, more manageable chunks. It also helps users to focus on one set of fields at a time, which can make the form-filling process less overwhelming.

However, it can also increase the complexity of the form, as the user has to go through several pages to complete the form. So it is necessary to evaluate the form requirement and user needs before deciding to use a wizard layout.

You can use the Wizard layout Core Component in an Adaptive Form to create Wizard layout.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-wizard-in-an-adaptive-form}

There are several reasons why it may be beneficial to use a Wizard layout in an Adaptive Form:

*   **Simplicity**: Breaking a form down into multiple steps can make it easier for users to understand and complete, as they can focus on one set of fields at a time.

*   **Organization**: A Wizard layout can help to organize forms by topic or purpose, and it can also group related fields together, which can make the form-filling process more logical and efficient.

*   **Validation**: A Wizard layout allows for step-by-step validation, which can help users identify and correct errors as they go, rather than waiting until the end of the form.

*   **Progress Indicator**: A wizard layout can display the progress of the form, which can help the user understand how much of the form is left to complete.

*   **Long forms**: If the form has a lot of fields, it can be overwhelming for the user to see them all at once, so breaking them down into smaller, more manageable chunks can make it less intimidating.

*   **Avoiding Abandonment**: A wizard layout can also help to reduce form abandonment, as users are more likely to complete a form if they can see progress and understand how much is left to do.

*   **Mobile Experience**: A wizard layout can also be beneficial for forms accessed on mobile devices, as it allows for smaller pages that load faster and are easier to navigate.

Overall, a Wizard layout can make the form-filling process more manageable and efficient for users, but it's important to consider the complexity of the form and the user's needs before deciding to use this type of layout.
