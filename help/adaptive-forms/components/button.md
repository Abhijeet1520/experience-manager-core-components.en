# Button Component {#button-component-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A button in an Adaptive Form is a UI element that allows users to initiate an action when clicked. The button element can be used to submit a form, reset a form, or perform other actions such as navigating to a different page or triggering custom code. The button can be created using the Button Core Component and can be styled using CSS.

The Adaptive Forms Rule Editor allows users to set various actions for the button component. These actions include opening a website, showing or hiding form components, adding an instance of a panel or component, submitting or resetting a form, and more.

Adaptive Forms also provide separate button components for submitting or resetting a form, but the button component can also be configured to perform these actions if needed.

Users can access the complete list of actions supported for the button component by using the Adaptive Forms Rule Editor. The Rule Editor allows users to create rules that are triggered by various events, such as when a button is clicked, when a form is loaded, or when a field value changes. These rules can then be used to perform various actions, such as showing or hiding components, setting field values, or submitting the form. 

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-button}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a button in an Adaptive Form, including:

*   **Form submission**: A button is typically used to submit a form, allowing users to send the data they have entered to the server for processing.

*   **Form reset**: Buttons can also be used to reset a form, clearing all the data entered by the user.

*   **Navigation**: Buttons can be used to navigate between different sections of a form or different pages on a website.

*   **Event Handling**: Buttons can be used to trigger different events like opening a website, show/hide components, add an instance of a panel or component to the button.

*   **Interactivity**: Buttons can be used to create interactive forms. For example, a button can be used to open a modal dialog or to toggle a section of the form.
