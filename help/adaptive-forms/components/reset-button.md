# Reset {#reset-button}

A reset button in an Adaptive Form is a button that allows users to clear or reset all the form fields to their default values. When the reset button is clicked, any data that has been entered into the form fields is deleted, and the fields return to their original state. The reset button is typically used as an alternative to the submit button and provides a way for users to start over if they have entered incorrect or unwanted data into the form.


## Usage {#reasons-to-use-reset-button}

The reasons to use a reset button in an Adaptive Form are:

*   **User Convenience**: A reset button provides a quick and easy way for users to clear the form and start over, without having to manually delete each field.

*   **Improved Usability**: A reset button can improve the user experience by allowing users to easily correct mistakes or change their inputs.

*   **Error Prevention**: By using a reset button, users can avoid accidentally submitting incorrect data, which can lead to errors or processing issues.

*   **Consistency**: Including a reset button in a form provides consistency in user experience, as reset buttons are a common feature of forms.

*   **Better Data Management**: By using a reset button, the form data can be kept organized and accurate, as users are less likely to submit inconsistent or incorrect data.
