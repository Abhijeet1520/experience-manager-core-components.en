# Footer {#footer-adaptive-forms-core-component}

A footer component in an Adaptive Form is an area that typically appears at the bottom of the form and contains information such as a copyright notice, links to related resources, or contact information. 

**Example**

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-footer}

There are several reasons why it is beneficial to include a footer component in a form, including:

*   **Legal requirements**: Some forms may be required to include a disclaimer, copyright notice, or other legal information. A footer is a convenient place to include this information.

*   **Navigation**: A footer can provide links to other important pages on the website, such as a privacy policy, terms of service, or contact page.

*   **Branding**: A footer can be used to include a logo or other branding elements, helping to reinforce the identity of the organization or website.

*   **Accessibility**: A footer can provide additional information, such as the date of the last update, which can be beneficial for users with accessibility needs.

*   **Consistency**: A footer provides consistency in the design and layout of the form, making it more intuitive and easy for users to navigate.

*   **Additional context**: A footer can provide additional context to the form, such as a text describing the form or a link to related resources, making the form more informative and user-friendly.
