# Submit button {#submit-button}

A Submit button in an Adaptive Form is a button that allows users to submit the form data to a server for processing. When the submit button is clicked, the form data is sent to the server, where it can be stored, processed, or used for various purposes such as sending an email or updating a database. 

The Submit button is typically the final step in the form-filling process, and is used to initiate the process of sending the form data to the server.

## Usage {#reasons-to-use-submit-button}

The reasons to use a submit button in an Adaptive Form are:

*   **Data Submission**: The submit button is the primary mechanism for submitting form data to a server for processing.

*   **Improved User Experience**: A well-designed submit button can improve the user experience by providing clear feedback on the form submission process and indicating when the form has been successfully submitted.

*   **Data Validation**: The submit button can be used to trigger data validation checks, ensuring that the form data is complete and accurate before it is sent to the server.
