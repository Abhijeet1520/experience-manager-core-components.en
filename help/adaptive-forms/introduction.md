# Adaptive Forms Core Components Introduction {#adaptive-forms-core-components-introduction}

Using the Adaptive Forms Core Components in Adobe Experience Manager, you can create compelling enrollment experiences by utilizing the flexibility and customization options available. 

## Core Components  {#overview}

In Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), components are the building blocks used to create pages and forms. They provide a simple and powerful way for authors to create and manage content, while also providing developers with the flexibility and extensibility needed to create custom components.

The Core Components are a set of pre-built, standardized WCM components that are designed to speed up development time and reduce maintenance costs for websites. These components include things like text fields, images, videos, and more. They are designed to be flexible and can be easily customized to match the specific needs of a website.

The Core Components are also designed to be responsive and support a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. They also adhere to the latest web standards and best practices, making them a robust and reliable solution for creating web content.

Additionally, the Core Components are built to work seamlessly with other parts of AEM, allowing authors and developers to create more engaging and interactive forms with less effort and less time.

Overall, the Core Components are an essential tool for creating and managing web content in AEM, providing a powerful and flexible solution that can help to reduce development time and maintenance costs, while also providing a great user experience to the website visitors.

In Adobe Experience Manager, components are the structural elements that constitute the content of the pages and forms being authored. Components have always been a fundamental element of the AEM experience, making page and form creation simple but powerful for the author and the development of components flexible and extensible for the developer. The Core Components are a set of standardized Web Content Management (WCM) components to speed up development time and reduce maintenance cost of your websites.

## Adaptive Forms Core Components

The Adaptive Forms Core Components are a set of 24 open-source, BEM-compliant components that are built on the foundation of the Adobe Experience Manager WCM Core Components. They are specifically designed to be used for creating Adaptive Forms, which are forms that adapt to the device, browser and screen size of the user.

These components can be used to create exceptional data capture and enrollment experiences by providing a wide range of form field options, including text fields, checkboxes, drop-down menus, and more. They also include features like validation, conditional logic, and responsive design, which can be used to create forms that are user-friendly and easy to use.

Additionally, as these components are open-source, developers have the ability to easily customize and extend the components to match the specific needs of their organization. And, These components are built on BEM methodology which ensures that they are scalable and maintainable.

## Benefits {#benefits}

Data capture experiences are crucial for lead generation and enrollment, and the Adaptive Forms Core Components provide a powerful solution for creating forms that are optimized for data capture. Some of the reasons to use Core Components to create these experiences are: 

*   **Customization**: Adaptive Forms Core Components allow developers to easily customize the appearance and behavior of form components, such as text fields, checkboxes, and drop-down menus, to meet specific requirements.

*   **Accessibility**: Adaptive Forms Core Components support accessibility standards and guidelines, such as  [WCAG 2.1 standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), to ensure that forms can be used by people with disabilities, including those using assistive technologies such as screen readers.

*   **Consistent forms**: By using Adaptive Forms Core Components, developers can create forms that have a consistent look and feel, making it easier for users to understand and complete the forms, leading to increased engagement and improved user experience.

*   **WYSIWYG editor**: AEM Forms provide a user-friendly interface, ease of use WYSIWYG editor to use these components to create an Adaptive Form. It allows forms authors to create and edit forms without needing to know how to code. It also includes a visual rule editor to help you easily create rule-based actions and implement complex logic to automate form behavior without having to write code. 

*   **Conditional logic**: Adaptive Forms Core Components support the use of conditional logic, which means that the appearance or behavior of form components can be changed based on the values entered by the user. For example, certain fields can be hidden or made mandatory based on the selection made in other fields.

*   **Data validation**: Adaptive Forms Core Components provide built-in data validation capabilities, allowing developers to ensure that user-entered data meets specific criteria, such as minimum and maximum lengths, required values, and specific formats.
