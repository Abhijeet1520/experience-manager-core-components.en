# Adaptive Forms Core Components Introduction {#adaptive-forms-core-components-introduction}

Using the Adaptive Forms Core Components in Adobe Experience Manager, you can create compelling enrollment experiences by utilizing the flexibility and customization options available. 

## Core Components  {#overview}

In Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), components are the building blocks used to create pages and forms. They provide a simple and powerful way for authors to create and manage content, while also providing developers with the flexibility and extensibility needed to create custom components.

The Core Components are a set of pre-built, standardized WCM components that are designed to speed up development time and reduce maintenance costs for websites. These components include things like text fields, images, videos, and more. They are designed to be flexible and can be easily customized to match the specific needs of a website.

The Core Components are also designed to be responsive and support a wide range of devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. They also adhere to the latest web standards and best practices, making them a robust and reliable solution for creating web content.

Additionally, the Core Components are built to work seamlessly with other parts of AEM, allowing authors and developers to create more engaging and interactive forms with less effort and less time.

Overall, the Core Components are an essential tool for creating and managing web content in AEM, providing a powerful and flexible solution that can help to reduce development time and maintenance costs, while also providing a great user experience to the website visitors.

In Adobe Experience Manager, components are the structural elements that constitute the content of the pages and forms being authored. Components have always been a fundamental element of the AEM experience, making page and form creation simple but powerful for the author and the development of components flexible and extensible for the developer. The Core Components are a set of standardized Web Content Management (WCM) components to speed up development time and reduce maintenance cost of your websites.

## Adaptive Forms Core Components

The Adaptive Forms Core Components are a set of over 20 open-source, BEM-compliant components that are built on the foundation of the Adobe Experience Manager WCM Core Components. They are specifically designed to be used for creating Adaptive Forms, which are forms that adapt to the device, browser and screen size of the user.

These components can be used to create exceptional data capture and enrollment experiences by providing a wide range of form field options, including text fields, checkboxes, drop-down menus, and more. They also include features like validation, conditional logic, and responsive design, which can be used to create forms that are user-friendly and easy to use.

Additionally, as these components are open-source, developers have the ability to easily customize and extend the components to match the specific needs of their organization. And, These components are built on BEM methodology which ensures that they are scalable and maintainable.

This helps to provide a consistent customer journey, which can lead to increased conversions and engagement.

*   The ability to reuse assets and content also promotes adherence to branding guidelines, which can optimize the content creation process. This allows authors to create forms that are visually consistent with other elements of the website, while also ensuring that they are optimized for data capture.

*   As the Adaptive Forms Core Components are open-source and BEM compliant, developers can easily customize the forms to match the specific requirements of their organization and branding guidelines. This allows you to create forms that are tailored to your specific needs, while also ensuring that they are scalable and maintainable.

In summary, the Adaptive Forms Core Components are a powerful and flexible solution for creating data capture forms that are optimized for lead generation and enrollment. They provide a simple, intuitive interface for authors to create and manage forms, while also providing developers with the flexibility and extensibility needed to create custom forms that match the specific needs of the organization.

## Features {#features}


*   The Adaptive Forms Core Components are built on top of the [WCM Core Components](/help/introduction.md), and therefore they also support [Editable Templates](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/sites/authoring/features/templates.html) and the Style System. This means that you can use the same templates and styles across your forms, pages, and other content, ensuring a consistent and cohesive look and feel throughout your website.

*   There are 18 production-ready components available to create forms, and you can use these components to create forms anywhere below /content. This makes it easy to organize and manage your forms, and you can use the same content management tools to manage your forms as you do for your other content.

*   It's also worth mentioning that the Adaptive Forms Core Components are [open-source](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components), which allows for easy customization and extensibility. Developers can use the source code to create custom components, and easily incorporate them into their forms. This allows for greater flexibility and control over the forms and their functionality, and also making it possible to create forms that are tailored to the specific needs of the organization.

In summary, the Adaptive Forms Core Components are a powerful and flexible solution for creating forms within Adobe Experience Manager. They are built on top of the WCM Core Components, which provides support for Editable Templates and the Style System, and also provides 18 production-ready components to create forms. As they are open-source, it makes it easy to customize and extend the components to match the specific needs of the organization.
