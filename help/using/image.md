# Image Component{#image-component}

The Core Component Image Component is an adaptive image component that features in-place editing.

## Usage {#usage}

The Image Component allows easy placement of image assets and offers in-place editing. It features adaptive image selection with lazy loading as well as cropping for the content author.

The image widths as well as cropping and additional settings can be defined by the template author in the [design dialog](image.md#main-pars_title_1995166862). The content editor can upload or select assets in the [configure dialog](image.md#main-pars_title_55926120) and crop the image in the [edit dialog](image.md#main-pars_title). For added convenience, simple in-place modification of the image is also available.

## Version and Compatibility {#version-and-compatibility}

The current version of the Image Component is v2, which was introduced with release 2.0.0 of the Core Components in January 2018, and is described in this document.

The following table details all supported versions of the component, the AEM versions with which the versions of the component is compatible, and links to documentation for previous versions.

|Component Version|AEM 6.3|AEM 6.4|
|--- |--- |--- |
|v2|Compatible|Compatible|
|[v1](image-v1.md )|Compatible|Compatible|

For more information about Core Component versions and releases, see the document [Core Components Versions](versions.md).

## SVG Support {#svg-support}

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are supported by the Image Component.

* Drag-and-drop of an SVG asset from DAM and upload of an SVG file upload from a local file system are both supported.
* The Adaptive Image Servlet streams the original SVG file is streamed (transformations are skipped).
* For an SVG image, the "smart images” and the "smart sizes” are set to an empty array in the image model.

### Security {#security}

For security reasons, the original SVG is never called directly by the Image Editor. It is called through `<img src=“path-to-component”>`. As such the browser prevents any scripts embedded in the SVG file from executing.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>SVG support requires release 2.1.0 of the Core Components or higher along with [service pack 2](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/release-notes/sp-release-notes.html) for AEM 6.4 or [service pack 3](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/release-notes/sp3-release-notes.html) for AEM 6.3 or higher to support [new image editor features](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/image-editor.html) within AEM.

## Configure Dialog {#configure-dialog}

In addition to the standard [edit dialog](image.md#main-pars_title) and [design dialog](image.md#main-pars_title_1995166862), the image component offers a configure dialog where the image itself is defined along with its description and basic properties.

### Asset Tab {#asset-tab}

![](assets/screen_shot_2018-01-08at114245.png)

* **Image asset**
  * Drop an asset from the [asset browser](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/authoring/using/author-environment-tools.html#main-pars_title) or tap the **browse** option to upload from a local file system.
  * Tap or click **Clear** to de-select the currently selected image.
  * Tap or click **Edit** to [mange the renditions of the asset](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/assets/using/managing-assets-touch-ui.html#main-pars_title_19) in the asset editor.

![](assets/screen_shot_2018-01-08at114527.png)

* **Image is decorative**
  Check if the image should be ignored by assistive technology and therefore does not require an alternative text. This applies to decorative images only.
* **Alternative text**
  Textual alternative of the meaning or function of the image, for visually impaired readers.
  * Get alternative text from DAM - When checked the image's alternative text will be populated with the value of the `dc:description` metadata in DAM.

* **Caption**
  Additional information about the image, displayed below the image by default.
  * **Get caption from DAM**
    When checked the image's caption text will be populated with the value of the `dc:title` metadata in DAM.

    When checked, the caption won't be displayed below the image, but as a pop-up displayed by some browsers when hovering over the image.

* **Link**
  * Link the image to another resource.
  * Use the selection dialog to link to another AEM resource.
  * If not linking to an AEM resource, enter the absolute URL. Non-solute URLs will be interpreted as relative to AEM.

## Edit Dialog {#edit-dialog}

The edit dialog allows the content author to crop, modify the launch map, and zoom the image.

![](assets/chlimage_1-8.png)

* Start Crop

  ![](assets/chlimage_1-9.png)

  Selecting this option opens a drop-down for pre-defined crop proportions.

  * Choose the option **Free Hand** to define your own crop.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >The Launch Map feature requires release 2.1.0 of the Core Components or higher along with [service pack 2](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/release-notes/sp-release-notes.html) for AEM 6.4 or [service pack 3](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-3/release-notes/sp3-release-notes.html) for AEM 6.3 or higher to support [new image editor features](https://helpx.adobe.com/experience-manager/6-4/sites/developing/using/image-editor.html) within AEM.

  ![](assets/chlimage_1-12.png)

  Use this option to apply a launch map to the image. Selecting this option opens a new window allowing the user select the shape of the map:

  * **Add Rectangular Map**
  * **Add Circular Map**

>[!NOTE]
>
>As of release 2.2.0 of the Core Components, the Image Component adds the unique UUID attribute `data-asset-id` to the image asset to allow tracking and analysis of the number of views that individual assets receive.

### Features Tab {#features-tab}

On the **Features** tab you can define which options are available to the content authors when using the component including upload options, orientation, and cropping options.

* Source

  ![](assets/chlimage_1-19.png)

  Select the option **Allow asset upload from file system** to allow content authors to upload images from his or her local computer. To force content authors to only select assets from AEM, de-select this option.

<p>Added caution based on CQDOC-11457. Hid the flip options in the procedure using the <strong>Draft</strong> option so that when this feature is implemented in CQ-4221539, the <strong>Draft</strong> property can simply be removed along with the caution.</p>
 -->

* Cropping

  ![](assets/chlimage_1-21.png)

  Select the option **Allow crop** to allow the content author to crop the image in the component in the edit dialog.
  * Click **Add** to add a pre-defined crop aspect ratio.
  * Enter a descriptive name, which will be shown in the **Start Crop** dropdown.
  * Enter the numerical ratio of the aspect.
  * Use the drag handles to re-arrange the order of the aspect ratios
  * Use the trash can icon to delete an aspect ratio.

  >[!CAUTION]
  >
  >Note that in AEM, crop aspect ratios are defined as **height/width**. This differs from the conventional definition of width/height and is done for legacy compatibility reasons. The content authors will not be aware of any difference as long as you provide a clear name of the ratio since the name is shown in the UI and not the ratio itself.

### Styles Tab {#styles-tab-1}

The Image Component supports the AEM [Style System](authoring.md#component-styling).
