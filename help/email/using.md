# Using the Email Core Components {#using}

## Installing the Email Core Components {#installation}

The Email Core Components can be used with AEM 6.5 and AEM as a Cloud Service. See the [Requirements section of the Email Core Components Introduction document](introduction.md#requirements) for more information. However the installation steps will differ depending on on which type of AEM installation you have.

### AEM as a Cloud Service {#aemaacs}

Simply create an AEM project using the AEM project archetype.

### AEM 6.5 {#aem-65}

The Email Core Components are built on the AEM Core Components. Because of this, you must first install the AEM Core Components before installing the Email Core Components.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Before you use the Email Core Components you should complete two important configuration steps:

* Configure your Adobe Campaign Integration
  * Adobe Campaign Classic
  * Adobe Cmapaign Standard
* Link the Adobe Campaign integration configuration to the content page where you will use the Email Core Components
