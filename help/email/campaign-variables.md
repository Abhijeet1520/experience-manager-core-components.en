# Campaign Variables {#campaign-variables}

Use campaign variables as placeholders to compose personalized email content.  Campaign Variables act as placeholders for Adobe Campaign values which you can insert into your email content. When the content is sent via Adobe Campaign, Campaign replaces those variables with the personalized content of the recipient.

## Select Adobe Campaign Variable Dialog {#dialog}

The Select Adobe Campaign Variable dialog is available in many edit dialogs of the Email Core Components. To use it simply click on the Adobe Campaign icon next to the applicable field.

Use the column view to locate the variable that you wish to insert. Clicking on a node in a column shows its children in a new column to the right. In this way you can navigate the variable content structure.

Select the variable you wish to insert and then click the checkmark at the top-right of the dialog.
